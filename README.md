# FosterCare
Our "Foster Care for Pets" project focuses on creating a user-friendly platform for shelter pets, especially injured/abandoned animals. We've utilized InVision for interactive prototypes, meticulous wireframing, UML diagrams, and embraced a collaborative workflow for success. Together, we aim to increase the chances pets to find permanent home.
